# MONNA Agent Permission Diff

**Review what changed in your agent's declared permissions before you merge.**

Local CLI, in-browser demo and GitHub Action. No API key, model, telemetry, external dependency installation or MCP server execution. Reports reference exact source lines and omit all configuration values.

This project is a configuration-change reviewer, not a security scanner or an effective-permission evaluator. It is designed to complement tools such as MCP Inspector and Agent Scan.

## First useful result in three commands

```sh
git clone https://github.com/emanalshazly/monna-agent-permission-diff.git
cd monna-agent-permission-diff
node cli.mjs examples/before.json examples/after.json --format markdown --fail-on none
```

Requires Node 22+. No npm install. The supplied example reports six changes, including a removed deny rule, a removed approval rule, a new directory entry and a switch to bypass mode. It does not run the configured commands. MIT licensed; contributions welcome.

## Review your configuration

```sh
node cli.mjs before.json after.json --type claude-settings
node cli.mjs before.json after.json --type mcp --format markdown
node cli.mjs before.json after.json --format sarif --fail-on medium
```

Outputs: JSON (default), Markdown, SARIF 2.1.0. Exit codes: **0** below your chosen threshold, **1** review threshold reached, **2** invalid input or unsupported format. Default threshold is `high`. For conservative automation including unknown-field changes, select `medium`. `none` reports without failing.

SARIF uses generic `before.json` / `after.json` artifact names to avoid disclosing file paths; stage your files under those names when uploading SARIF. The tool produces SARIF; it does not upload it or automatically comment on pull requests.

## Supported formats and limits

| Format | Explicitly modeled fields |
|---|---|
| Claude settings | `permissions.allow`, `.deny`, `.ask`, `.additionalDirectories`, `.defaultMode` |
| MCP JSON | `mcpServers`; each server's `command`, ordered `args`, `url`, `type`, `env`, `headers`, `disabled` |

Client-specific extensions are not automatically understood. MCP JSON is a client configuration convention, not a complete authorization model defined by MCP itself. A server addition does not prove new runtime access. `disabled` semantics depend on the client. Unknown fields produce partial coverage; changed unknown fields produce review findings. Known cosmetic fields are not silently discarded in this initial release.

Permission lists compare as sets; executable arguments compare in order. Paths and rule expressions compare literally: no glob equivalence, path resolution, symlink following or managed-policy merging. Reports indicate potential expansion/reduction, never claim new effective access. Added allow and removed deny/ask rules still need review even when another rule might override them.

Strict UTF-8 JSON only: no JSONC, comments or trailing commas. Duplicate keys, nonfinite numbers and malformed consumed fields are rejected. Input limits: 2 MB bytes per file, 1 million characters, nesting depth 64 and 50,000 parsed nodes. Large inputs fail visibly rather than being truncated.

## GitHub Action

Use a reviewed commit SHA instead of a moving branch in production. Prepare `before.json` from the trusted base revision and `after.json` from the proposed change. Keep both files inside the workspace. The Action does not retrieve revisions or guess the base. Use `pull_request`, not privileged `pull_request_target`, for untrusted contribution code.

```yaml
permissions:
  contents: read
steps:
  # First check out your repository and prepare before.json / after.json.
  - uses: emanalshazly/monna-agent-permission-diff@main
    with:
      before: before.json
      after: after.json
      type: claude-settings
      fail-on: medium
```

The action needs Node 22+ on the runner. It adds the redacted report to the job summary and exposes `report-path`. Input values are passed through environment variables and a shell-free argument array. It checks that file targets remain within the workspace, including symlink resolution. No write token is required. Pinning instructions will accompany the first verified release.

## Browser demo

The root `index.html` and ES modules are a static site with English/Arabic controls. Run `node preview.mjs` and open `http://127.0.0.1:8432`, or use any static HTTP server; opening the HTML via `file://` may block module imports. Select local files or paste JSON, then compare. Files are read using the browser File API and are not uploaded. Initial site assets are fetched normally; analysis itself makes no network calls. Findings retain stable English rule identifiers and descriptions.

## Verification and comparison

```sh
node --test
node benchmark/run.mjs
```

The suite covers malformed input, line evidence, permission changes, credential canaries, CLI behavior, GitHub summaries and deterministic comparisons. The benchmark is a small synthetic suite, not independent validation or proof of market superiority. See [comparison evidence](docs/COMPARISON.md) and [quality gates](docs/QUALITY.md).

## Why MONNA built this

Reviewers should see which authority-related settings changed without having to execute an unfamiliar MCP server or send its configuration for analysis. MONNA's focus is practical agent governance: explain the evidence, make uncertainty visible, keep the final decision with the owner.
